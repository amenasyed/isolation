# Isolation

In this 2-player strategy game, the objective is to isolate your opponent's game piece so they are unable to make any further moves

HOW TO PLAY:
1. Before playing, you and your opponent will be prompted to configure your names, starting platforms and board size

2. For each player's turn, they will be asked to move their own gamepiece to a coordinate on the board and remove any other tile from the board

3. The player will be asked to make this move denoted by 4 lowercase letters (ie. 'abcd' )
    a. In this case, 'a' denotes the row and 'b' denotes the column that the player wishes to move their gamepiece to
    b. Likewise, 'c' and 'd' respectively represent the row and column of the tile the player wishes to remove from the board
   
4. Keep in mind that you cannot move your gamepiece more than one space in any direction

5. However, you are allowed to remove any free spaces as long as a gamepiece is on it or it isn't a starting platform

6. Once you completely isolate your opponent on all 8 of their surrounding tiles, you win!

7. If both you and your opponent cannot make any further moves (ie. you are BOTH isolated), the game is a draw

NOTE: If you decide to quit the game, simply type 'q' or 'quit' when your turn is prompted
